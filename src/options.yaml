## Options definitions

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Enums

enum CpsCandidatePrimitiveMode:
    # Controls how candidate primitives are handled in the continuations (CPS) software Traversal loop.
    SuspendLane:  # Suspend a lane upon candidate hits and wait for other lanes to end the Traversal loop.
                  #  This is the default. Other modes are experimental and might not be implemented on all RtIps.
    DeferFirst:   # When finding the first candidate, record it and ignore it for the time being. At the end of the
                  #  Traversal loop, process pending candidates. When finding the second candidate, immediately break
                  #  out of the loop to first process the first one.
                  #  Implementation status:
                  #   * RtIp 1.1: Not supported, SuspendLane is always used.
                  #   * RtIp 2.0: DeferFirst is supported, but only for triangle primitives.

# This is the definition of the single options struct.
# An option is represented by a sequence entry whose name is the name of the option, and it is itself
# a sequence with entries:
# - Type: the type of the field.
# - Default (optional): the default value of the field.
Options:

    threadTraceEnabled:
        Type: uint32
        Default: 0

    cpsCandidatePrimitiveMode:
        Type: CpsCandidatePrimitiveMode
        Default: CpsCandidatePrimitiveMode::SuspendLane

    persistentLaunchEnabled:
        Type: uint32
        Default: 0

    rayFlagsOverrideForceEnableMask:
        # The incoming TraceRay ray flags are ORed with this mask before use, allowing to force-enable specific flags.
        # In case of conflicting bits with the disable mask, the enable mask wins, as it is applied after the disable mask.
        # Only supported with continuations.
        Type: uint32
        Default: 0

    rayFlagsOverrideForceDisableMask:
        # The incoming TraceRay ray flags are ANDed with the bitwise inverse of this mask before use, allowing to force-disable specific flags.
        # Only supported with continuations.
        Type: uint32
        Default: 0

    rtDispatchRaysThreadGroupSize:
        # Thread Group size to use when calling DispatchRays
        Type: uint32
        Default: 32
